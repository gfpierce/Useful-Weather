# Useful-Weather
A weather website that helps you make decisions about your life.

You know how you look at weather and just see a whole bunch of numbers?
Sure, you know roughly what 60 degrees feels like, what 90% humidity feels like, and what rain is, but what does it mean for your day?

Useful Weather aims to answer that question.

Rather than just feeding you a bunch of raw data, Useful Weather will crunch the numbers and tell you useful information.
Instead of just "it's 68 and sunny," we'll tell you something like "it's nice out, and should remain a nice temperature throughtout the day. You may want to have a light jacket towards the later hours, but overall it should be okay."

Is it going to rain in the afternoon?
Instead of "chance of rain at 3pm," you'll see "it might rain in the afternoon. Keep a rain jacket or umbrella close by if you have to head out."

The goal of Useful Weather is to make our online weather services talk about weather in the same way that we would. We'll collect the necessary data and do the thinking for you, making it easier for you to go about your day. We aim to distill the day's weather forecast into a concise description in natural language.
